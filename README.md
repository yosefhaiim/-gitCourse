Welcome to git course! This project is designed to solve how to work with github in a simple and efficient way. Below you can see a brief overview of the code.

## Code Example

Here's a small code snippet that demonstrates one of the key features of this project:

```csharp
// This is a simple function that adds two numbers
public int Add(int a, int b) 
{
    return a + b; // Returns the sum of a and b
}
